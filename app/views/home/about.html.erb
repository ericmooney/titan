      <p>Titan Shoring & Construction, LLC is a foundation and house raising contractor with more than 20 years of heavy foundation construction experience working along the New Jersey Coast.</p>

      <p>Titan is a certified installer of <a href='www.idealfoundationsystems.com'>Ideal Foundation Systems’</a>  helical pilings and their components. We can utilize these helical pilings to repair an undermined foundation, shoring up a settling wall, or secure an elevated house on a piling foundation when relocation is not an option.</p>

      <p>Titan Shoring & Construction, LLC has taken great strides to ensure that we carry the proper insurance to safely operate in the house raising and foundation construction industry. Along with our general liability and worker’s compensation policies, we also carry a Care, Custody, and Control endorsement which provides coverage to the home and its contents while it is elevated off of its permanent foundation.</p>

      <p>Titan Shoring & Construction, LLC is owned and operated by lifelong residents of the Greater Atlantic City region and employs New Jersey residents. We utilize local suppliers for materials needed on each job because we strongly believe in supporting New Jersey businesses first.</p>
